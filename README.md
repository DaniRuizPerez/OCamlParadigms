Hitori Puzzle Solver
============

This Hitori Puzzle Solver is one of the projects that I developed for the Knowledge Representation and Automatic Reasoning course in the junior year of my undergrad in computer science at UDC (Spain). It transforms a simplified version of the Hitori puzzle into a set of CNF boolean clauses based on the rules of the game, calls a propositional satisfiability (SAT) solver and creates the solution.
