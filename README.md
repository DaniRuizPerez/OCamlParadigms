Programming Paradigms (OCaml)
============

This is a collection of OCaml projects that I developed for the Programming Paradigms course in the sophomore year of my BSc in computer science at UDC (Spain). 

- **[LICENSE](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/Ocaml/blob/master/LICENSE)Recursive list implementation** and operations over the list (length, concat, append, join, combine...)
- **Tail recursion sorting** analysis of given functions 
- **Object oriented dynamic array** with the following methods:
	- addLast(element)
	- add(element,position)
	- overwrite(element,position)
	- lenght()
	- get(position)
	- index(position)
	- toString()
	- toStringBuffer()
- **World of blocks solver**. Given a starting configuration and a goal, it efficiently produces the set of moves (up, down, left, right, grab, drop) that transform the starting configuration into the finishing configuration. Also a given (by the professor) .tcl script provides a graphical interface that animates the sequence.
