Programming Paradigms (OCaml)
============

This is a collection of OCaml projects (Tail recursion, Object Oriented, Problem solving....) that I developed for the Programming Paradigms course in the sophomore year of my BSc in computer science at UDC (Spain). 

- **[Recursive list implementation](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/Ocaml/blob/master/MyList.ml)** and operations over the list (length, concat, append, join, combine...)
- **[Tail recursion sorting](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/Ocaml/blob/master/TailRecursion.ml)** analysis of given functions 
- **[Object oriented dynamic array](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/Ocaml/blob/master/DynamicArray.ml)** with the following methods:
	- addLast(element)
	- add(element,position)
	- overwrite(element,position)
	- lenght()
	- get(position)
	- index(position)
	- toString()
	- toStringBuffer()
- **[World of blocks solver](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/Ocaml/blob/master/bloques.ml)**. Given a starting configuration and a goal, it efficiently produces the set of moves (up, down, left, right, grab, drop) that transform the starting configuration into the finishing configuration. Also a given (by the professor) [.tcl](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/Ocaml/blob/master/blq.tcl) script provides a graphical interface that animates the sequence.
